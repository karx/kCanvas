## 2024-10-24 - [Keyboard Shortcuts & Focus Styles]
**Learning:** Adding keyboard shortcuts to button titles (e.g., "Pause (Space)") is a high-value, low-effort way to improve feature discoverability without cluttering the UI. Combining this with clear `:focus-visible` styles makes the app much friendlier to power users and keyboard navigators.
**Action:** Default to including shortcut keys in tooltips/titles for all action buttons that have hotkeys. Ensure `:focus-visible` is always defined for interactive elements in custom dark themes.
