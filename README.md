# kCanvas Experiments

This repository is a collection of experiments with the HTML5 Canvas API, WebGL, and simulations of Langton's Ant. The project serves as a learning playground for various graphics-related concepts on the web.

## Overview

The project is structured as a series of experiments, each in its own directory. These experiments range from basic canvas usage to more complex simulations and 3D graphics.

For a detailed visual summary of the project's structure, please see [PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md).

For the original, in-depth tutorial and the author's journey with the Canvas API, please refer to [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md).

## Experiments

*   **WebGL**: Contains experiments with WebGL.
*   **attempt2/ to attempt8/**: A series of iterative experiments with the Canvas API.
*   **langton3d/**: A 3D implementation of Langton's Ant.
*   **langtonHexD/**: Langton's Ant on a hexagonal grid.
*   **langtonSound/**: Langton's Ant with sound.

## Getting Started

To run any of the experiments, you will need a local web server. The original author recommends `http-server`.

```bash
http-server . --cors=*
```

Then, navigate to the respective `index.html` or `kaaro.html` file in your browser.

## Contributing

This project is primarily a personal learning journey. However, if you find any bugs or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue.
